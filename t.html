        <h1>The Craft of UI</h1>
        <p>
          Master the tools, mindset, and techniques behind crafting exceptional
          user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
        </p>
      </header>
      <hr />
      <p>
        What if you could build anything you see? Not just copy a design, but
        really understand it. To break it down. To know which tools to reach
        for. Built it with precision, performance, and accessibility in mind. To
        make it feel right and make it your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building user interfaces is complex. Even a “simple” sign-up form means
        making calls about motion, accessibility, performance — and all the
        finer UX details that most people never see. And too often, education
        only covers slices of that complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might learn how to make something look good or move well. But what
        about making it work right? For everyone? What about building fast,
        inclusive, resilient interfaces that feel effortless?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Craft of UI</strong> is a course about how to build things
        well. It’s about learning how to see like a developer who understands
        design, and code like a developer who cares about users.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s about working with the web — not fighting it. Leveraging the power
        of HTML and CSS. Sprinkling in enough JavaScript when it adds real
        magic. And reaching for libraries only when they truly help you go
        further. It’s not about chasing trends or selling you “taste”. It’s
        about timeless skills that level you up and pay the bills. Tools change.
        APIs evolve. But the foundations of the web platform are your unfair
        advantage when mastered.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don’t need to be “a natural”. You just need the right approach. The
        right mindset. With practice, you become the person who can build
        anything. Whether you’re starting out or already the team’s go-to, this
        course will help you level up and build with confidence.
      </p>
      <p>You’ll learn to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Think through UI problems, not just code them</li>
        <li>Use the web platform fully before adding dependencies</li>
        <li>Know when (and why) to reach for libraries or frameworks</li>
        <li>Explore emerging browser APIs so you’re ready when they land</li>
        <li>Build fast, accessible, resilient UIs that make people go “wow”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Over the years, I’ve built a reputation for being able to recreate just
        about anything passed my way. But the real secret isn’t “tricks”. It’s
        mindset, curiosity, and knowing how to think through a UI challenge, not
        just code it. I want to teach you how I do it — how I see a UI, break it
        down, and bring it to life. This course is everything I’ve learned from
        over a decade of experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’ve ever looked at a design and thought, “How would I build
        that?”, this is for you. It’s about equipping you with the skills to
        build whatever you need, and the confidence to say, “I’ve got this”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because when you can do that, everything changes. You’re not chasing
        snippets. You’re not limited by tools or libraries. You become the tool.
        You become the documentation. You move fast and solve problems
        confidently like it’s second nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        You bring ideas to life and you make it look easy. It’s not just
        satisfying, it’s how you 10x your career. You become the person the team
        turns to when they say: “Can we even build this?”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could you become that person? Yes. You could. And I’ll show you how.
      </p>
      <p>Let's go.</p>
